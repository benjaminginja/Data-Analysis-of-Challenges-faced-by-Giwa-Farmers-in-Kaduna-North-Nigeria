# Data-Analysis-of-Challenges-faced-by-Giwa-Farmers-in-Kaduna-North-Nigeria
The data highlights the pressing challenges faced by farmers in four communities in Giwa local government area in Kaduna North Nigeria, particularly regarding access to training, farming techniques, financial services, quality inputs, and the ability to adapt to climate change. The data provides insights into the pressing issues within the agricultural sector in this region and offers recommendations for addressing these challenges.
This information can be used by policymakers, agricultural extension services, and development organizations to design effective interventions that support the farmers in this region.

# Documentation 
# Data Sources
The data for this analysis was collected through surveys I conducted among farmers in 4 communities in Kaduna North Nigeria. It includes information on their educational background, training received, and their perceptions of the challenges they face in farming using Google Forms.

# Analysis
To have a proper understanding of the distribution of these challenges for each community out of the four, the data was then transferred to Excel for further analysis using power query to clean the data and Pivot tables and charts to analyze and visualize the data focused on  200 responses only counting 50 for each community.

# Conclusion
The analysis of challenges faced by Northern Nigerian farmers underscores the critical need for increased access to education and training, particularly in modern farming techniques. Addressing these challenges is essential for improving agricultural productivity and supporting the livelihoods of farmers in the region.
